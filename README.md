raw_data.mat includes:
1) tapping_data structure with asynchronies (e), inter-tap-intervals (r) and inter-stimulus-intervals (s) for all subjects, conditions and repetitions. Each array is 109 (n_subjects) x 6 (n_conditions) x 2 (n_repetitions).
2) subject_info table with demographics and other important info about the subjects - group, gender, age, reading skills etc.
3) aq_data - aq50 answers of a subset of the subjects (reverse coding questions already flipped)


main_scripts includes:
1) analysis_data.m - takes raw_data as input and generates ALL data for the paper, supplementary etc.
2) analysis_stats.m - statistics throughout the paper using the data generated by analysis_data.m & raw_data.mat
3) create_figures.m - create all figures in the paper (except the schematic illustrations of the model created using illustrator) - uses the data generated by analysis_data.m & raw_data.mat

Functions used by the 3 scripts are under the functions folder (model fitting, graphics, generating summary tables of statistics etc).

For model fitting functions see also: http://www.norijacoby.com/bgls.htm

The figures use these two handy functions (included in the reporistory):
